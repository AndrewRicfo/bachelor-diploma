# Applied math NTUU "KPI" bachelor diploma

## Theme
Mathematical model of internal exposure dose formation for population after Chornobyl accident

## About
User can download .csv file with the data about population and train neural network. Then the values of weights can be saved to .h5 file or simply used to predict the values of internal exposure dose of population based on data that describe people (age, profession, distance to the nearest city center or forest and so on) but lacks the information about internal exposure dose.
This project may save a lot of time for scientists who forced to ride all over the Ukraine and gather the information.

## Technologies used
- python(tensorflow)
- QT
